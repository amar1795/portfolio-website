            My Name is Amarjeet Singh , Currently a fullStack web developer with

            So It Took me 5 years to realize my love and passion for Fullstack
            developement as a job since i already have 3.5 years of experience
            in customer success and travel consultant roles but i didn’t get
            that freedom to be creative and to create the things what i imagine
            and bring that into reality .
          </p>
          <p className=" my-4 mt-[3rem]  below-550:text-[0.8rem] uppercase below-400:text-[0.4rem] below-400:my-5">
            Since the experience from my previous jobs have helped me in
            creating products which the customer like and seeing the product
            from their perspective hence this job makes me more creative in
            delivering success.
          </p>

            I also deal with ADHD which initially was a barrier for me as i
            couldn’t concentrate properly not even for 10 minutes straight … but
            as soon as i started to learn web development it became a ritual to
            practice concentration as a job 
          </p>
          <p className=" my-4 mt-[3rem]  below-550:text-[0.8rem] uppercase below-400:text-[0.4rem] below-400:my-5">
          slowly and gradually after 8 months
            i got good at it and now i really feel that those 8 months when the
            progress was nearly negligible while learning web devlopment those 8
            months of concentration and discipline finally paid off and now i
            feel more confident in learning anything … Yes i mean anything ….
