            Prologue: The Brain Fry – How I Torched My Potential

            Picture this: Fresh out of 12th grade, I slammed the books shut with a smug grin. "I've learned enough," I convinced myself. No more grinding skills, no more pushing boundaries. College crashed in like a foggy dream – zero motivation, no real goals in sight. Days blurred into endless loops of blasting music through my headphones, losing myself in wild daydreams that hijacked my entire schedule, and diving deep into computer games that lit up my screen but short-circuited my brain. I used to be that geeky kid, always experimenting with the latest gadgets, tearing them apart and rebuilding them just for the thrill.

             But after three relentless years of this autopilot existence? Poof – the spark vanished. I morphed into a shadow of myself, terrified to tackle anything new because my focus shattered like glass under pressure. ADHD ramped up to an all-time high, turning me into a fast-talking manic blur with zero patience for the world. I'd sprawl out, binge-watching movies, scrolling through endless YouTube rabbit holes, and looping songs on repeat, all while my life drifted without a single anchor or direction.

            Then COVID slammed the brakes on everything, and I thought, "Alright, this is my reset button." With a work-from-home job handing me pockets of free time, I geared up to prep for NIMCET – that intense MCA entrance exam that could pivot my future. But old habits die hard. Mid-study sessions, I'd zone out completely, no matter how hard I tried to lock in. Retention? Nonexistent. I skipped hanging out with friends or enjoying any downtime, telling myself it was to "make up" for the lost hours in daydreams, but really, it was just avoidance. 
            </p>
            <p className="leading-loose my-4 mt-[3rem] text-xs  below-500:text-xs below-500:my-5 text-green-100 italic">Two whole years evaporated in this cycle of half-hearted attempts and frustration. The irony hit like a punchline: In 2020, when I randomly guessed my way through the exam, I scored way higher than after another full year of supposed "preparation." That's when it sank in – I'd fried my brain to an unimaginable crisp, leaving behind a version of me that couldn't even dream of the potential I'd once had.

          Fast-forward through the haze: I landed a gig at British Airways as a travel consultant. Why that job? Simple – to break free from the isolating work-from-home trap and immerse myself in a buzzing environment full of people, hoping that human interaction would jolt me back to feeling normal again. And damn, it delivered.

          <p className=" my-4 mt-[3rem] text-xs  leading-loose below-500:text-xs below-500:my-5 text-green-100 italic"> After nearly a year of handling chaotic customer queries, navigating high-pressure scenarios, and thriving in the real-world energy, something shifted. I started feeling like myself – focused, engaged, alive. That spark ignited a decision: One last all-in push to overhaul my career. Four months before quitting, I enrolled in a bootcamp, but let's be real – I was starting from absolute zero, still that same scattered mind struggling to grasp basics.
          </p>

          <p className=" my-4 mt-[3rem] text-xs  leading-loose below-500:text-xs below-500:my-5 text-green-100 italic"> The quit day came, and I dove headfirst into the abyss: Grinding day and night on core concepts like Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, the full MERN stack, React frameworks, and web securities. I'd loop through the material over and over, pounding it into my skull.

              But 2023? It was pure tutorial hell – an entire year trapped in endless videos and guides, absorbing theory but building nothing tangible. No progress, just repetition without application. Then, the brutal realization struck in April 2024: I couldn't even whip up a basic app on my own. It was a wake-up call that screamed, "Time to rebel against this cycle."

          The Rebellion: Building Empires from Scratch

         No more crutches like endless tutorials – I was done with that passive BS. I set my sights on building a full-stack e-commerce app from the ground up, something ambitious to force growth. I researched tech stacks relentlessly and settled on Next.js for its powerhouse features: Server-side rendering for lightning-fast loads, server actions and components to streamline development and make the whole process way more efficient. But here's the twist – I had zero clue how to start, and watching more videos wasn't an option; that path led nowhere. So, for the first time ever, I cracked open the official docs, diving into the raw knowledge without filters. Rookie mistake: I wasted a full week overlearning every nook and cranny, getting lost in the weeds.

          <p className=" leading-loose my-4 text-xs  below-500:text-xs below-500:my-5 text-green-100 italic">
         Lesson learned – I pivoted hard, adopting a "learn-as-you-build" flow: Only absorb what the project demanded right then and there. Over the next three intense months, I poured blood, sweat, and countless late nights into it. Integrated seamless payment gateways, optimized images for speed without sacrificing quality, tuned servers for peak performance, implemented rate limiting to fend off abuse, set up email-based password resets, and layered in two-step verification for ironclad security. The UI? Yeah, it was rough around the edges, kind of ugly if I'm honest, but the real win was building every single component from scratch – no pre-made libraries to lean on. Along the way, I mastered Tailwind CSS, turning styling into an intuitive weapon. Boom: A fully functional, full-fledged app emerged, and just like that, I transformed into a Next.js pro, confident in wielding its power for anything.

          <p className=" leading-loose my-4 text-xs  below-500:text-xs below-500:my-5 text-green-100 italic">
        The momentum was electric now. I channeled it into crafting my portfolio site – a sleek showcase that I loved every bit of, built in just a day and a half because things were finally clicking. From there, I cranked out a series of smaller, basic apps down the line, each one sharpening my instincts. The best part? I now intuitively knew which tech stack to pick for any project and how to architect and build anything from the ground up. But victory's sweet high didn't last – depression ambushed me hard. Projects wrapped, but job applications flew out into the void with zero responses. I spiraled, doing nothing productive for three long months until October, wallowing in that familiar fog.

       The Ascent: DSA Domination and Real-World Wins

          The bootcamp I joined earlier promised placement once I nailed DSA, so I snapped out of it. Took a full month off to recharge: Traveled to a few spots, soaked in the vibes at Pushkar, let loose and enjoyed life without the weight. Came back refreshed, done being that lost version of myself – the guy who'd faded after 12th grade. This wasn't me; fear had no place anymore. It was time to reclaim the driven beast I used to be. I attacked DSA head-on, starting from the absolute basics and building up to advanced levels, slow and steady, no rushing the process. By the end of February 2025, I was brimming with confidence, acing every challenge. Bootcamp mock interviews? Cleared them like a total cakewalk, no sweat.

March rolled in, and I leveled up further: Immersed myself in High-Level Design (HLD), diving deep into system designs – understanding why they're crucial for scalable apps, how to architect robust systems, and exploring microservices architecture along with everything related to building resilient, efficient ecosystems. By now, the fog had lifted completely; everything felt like smooth sailing, concepts clicking effortlessly where they once felt impossible.

Opportunity knocked mid-grind: A client from a small company needed scanned PDFs converted to editable Excel sheets. I harnessed AI tools, built a custom Electron desktop app in just three days, achieving 92-95% accuracy that blew them away. They loved it – and so did I. For the first time, I'd created something that real people would use daily, solving a genuine business pain point. That rush? Pure validation. Around the same time, I secured a few internship offers, including a solid 6-month one. But the companies were lowballing on pay and had toxic cultures that screamed red flags – so I passed, refusing to settle. Now, I'm upskilling relentlessly, applying for roles in fullstack, frontend, backend, or React Native – wherever the next battle calls.          </p>

          Hey, I'm Amarjeet Singh – the fullstack renegade who morphs chaos into code empires. It took five gritty years to ditch the corporate grind of customer success and travel consulting (yeah, 3.5 years of that soul-sucking routine) and chase my true fire: crafting stunning UI-driven websites and apps that don't just work – they dominate. Those old gigs? They sharpened my edge, teaching me to build products users crave, always eyeing it from their side of the screen. Now? I wield code like a weapon, blending creativity with chaos to deliver experiences that hit hard.

ADHD tried to chain me down – couldn't focus for 10 damn minutes without my brain staging a revolt. But I flipped the script: locked myself away for a full year, zero contact with the world, laser-focused on rewriting my life. No distractions, just raw introspection and grind. In that isolation, I cracked the code on how to learn anything. From a guy who couldn't wrap his head around a basic few-line passage to a machine confident in dominating any field – tech, sports, whatever. Daydreaming? Gone. Zoning out? Eradicated. Confidence? Sky-high and unbreakable.          </p>

Web dev became my battlefield. Eight months of grinding through near-zero progress, forcing discipline into my veins like a ritual. Fast-forward 1.3 years from mid-2023, and boom: I'm a fullstack beast, slinging React Native mobile clones, Next.js e-com empires, and whatever tech madness sparks next. Finally found my passion – and it's all I crave.          </p>

What fuels the fire? When frustration hits, I unleash: pounding pavements on epic runs, crushing weights in savage workouts, or blasting through DOOM marathons and racing sims until the steam's gone. Bored or got free time? I reverse-engineer apps and websites, dissecting their guts to level up my skills, or dive into constant learning mode. Otherwise, it's all-in on physical chaos – running, swimming, badminton – or losing myself in PC games like GTA, Witcher, and Far Cry. Born gamer, eternal adventurer.       </p>
